# Generative Medical Imaging Laboratory (GMI)

The **Generative Medical Imaging Laboratory (GMI)** is a Python package designed to support advanced computational imaging research. GMI provides a suite of tools for linear algebra, stochastic differential equations, and diffusion models, built upon PyTorch to facilitate robust and scalable development of imaging solutions. 

## Features
- Comprehensive linear algebra modules for matrix operations and decompositions
- Stochastic differential equation solvers for simulating random processes
- Diffusion model implementations for high-resolution image reconstruction and generation

## Installation

You can install the GMI package directly from GitHub using the following command:

pip install git+https://github.com/Generative-Medical-Imaging-Lab/gmi.git

This will install the package and all required dependencies, enabling you to directly use its functionality within your Python environment.

## Requirements

The primary dependencies are:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- PyTorch (for GPU acceleration and deep learning modules)

Additional dependencies will be installed automatically with the package.

## Usage

After installation, you can import the `gmi` package and use its modules in your Python projects as shown below:

import gmi
